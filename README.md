# Create a Movie Rating App

# Challenge Description
Your task is to create a Movie Rating App using Vue.js 3.
During this challenge, weâ€™ll code out the following features:
- Rendering a list of movies.

## Requirements

# Challenge 1
- Define the movies as reactive data.
- Use the Vue.js template syntax to display the movie information.
- Render all the movies with a `v-for` loop.
- Display the name, description, genres, and image of each movie.
- Display the movie rating as stars, with a maximum of 5 stars

# Challenge 2
- Remove the display-only stars that we coded in the last challenge
- Create buttons for each rating from 1 to 5 and display a star inside.
- Color the stars based on the movie rating. For example, if the movie rating is 3, color 3 stars yellow and 2 gray.
- Allow the end user to click on any of the 5 buttons to update the movie rating accordingly.
- Disable the button for the currently selected rating to prevent the user from giving the same rating twice.



## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- TailwindCSS is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)

## Example of Finished App

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
